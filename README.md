# Statistical Reinforcement Learning package

This package "statisticalRL" encapusulates 3 PYPI packages:

- **statisticalRL-environments**: dedicated to definitions of environments such as Multi-armed Bandits and Makov Decision Processes
- **statisticalRL-learners**: dedicated to definitions of learning agents such as Upper Confidence Bound (UCB) agent or  Upper Confidence for Reinforcement Learning (UCRL) agent.
- **statisticalRL-experiments**: dedicated to running experiments, storing and visualizing results to produce plots ready for integration in a research article.

  On top of that, the project contains a repostiroty named "article" to reproduce experiments from research articles.
