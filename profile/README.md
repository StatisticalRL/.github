## Statistical Reinforcement Learning

In this repository, you will find 4 pacakages:

- **environments**: This defines several Reinforcement Learning environments, especially discrete (tabular) Markov Decision Processes and Multi-armed Bandits.
- **learners**:  This defines several Reinforcement Learning learning agents, including classical UCB algorithm for bandits or UCRL2 for Markov Decision Processes.
- **experiments**: This defines useful tools to run and compare regret of multiple algorithms in the same environment, producing regret plots and log files directly usable in a research article.
- **articles**: A list of articles using this library, with companion code to fully reproduce experiments from  these articles (using the version of the lib available at that time)

## Installation

    pip install statisticalRL==2.2507
